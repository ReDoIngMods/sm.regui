[h1]A Community-Based GUI Library for Scrap Mechanic[/h1]
sm.regui is a [b]Scrap Mechanic library mod[/b] that allows modders to [b]create advanced graphical user interfaces[/b] that are normally not possible with sm.gui.

With sm.regui, you can:
[list]
    [*] [b]Create, destroy, and fully control widgets[/b]
    [*] Use a flexible template system
    [*] Support fullscreen GUIs (allowing widgets to be placed anywhere on the screen and adapt to all in-game resolutions)
    [*] Use functions that are now implemented! (e.g., GuiInterface:setData)
    [*] Easily translate text with a built-in translation system
    [*] Draw any font you desire in any rotation*
    [*] Create lists with the flexible widgets API.
    [*] Play high-quality compressed 720p video.
[/list]

[h1]Notes about this library:[/h1]

    [h2]This library is not guranteed to work in future game updates![/h2]
    This GUI library uses a JSON exploit that allows modders to create MyGui Layout Files! As a result, the library may break in future game updates.

    [h2]Consider optimization if you're using sm.regui for animations, etc.[/h2]
    The GUI exploit being used will result in bloated files that [b]cannot be deleted without user assistance.[/b]
    
    For example, Anything related for positioning and resizing (as a animation) should be done with controllers to reduce bloat.

    [h2]Not Supported in MyGui LayoutEditor[/h2]
    sm.regui uses a custom layout file structure (called relayout with the .relayout extension) that wont work with the MyGui Layout editor at all!

    If you want to create relayout files, you only got a few choices:
    [list]
        [*] Use a editor like [strike][noparse]MyGui.NET[/noparse] For SM[/strike] [i](Note: [noparse]MyGui.NET[/noparse] For SM does not support this yet, but support is planned.)[/i]
        [*] Write the relayout file manually.
        [*] Use a .layout to .relayout converter. (One provided in [i]DevTools/LayoutToRelayout/[/i])
    [/list]
