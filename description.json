   "description" : "[h1]A Community-Based GUI Library for Scrap Mechanic[/h1]\r\nsm.regui is a [b]Scrap Mechanic library mod[/b] that allows modders to [b]create advanced graphical user interfaces[/b] that are normally not possible with sm.gui.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n    [h2]This GUI library was possible thanks to [b]The Red Builder[/b][/h2]\r\n    Thanks to [b]The Red Builder[/b], I have been able to create this GUI library for all modders out there! Without him, this library wouldn’t even exist and none of this would've been possible.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nWith sm.regui, you can:\r\n[list]\r\n    [*] [b]Create, destroy, and fully control widgets[/b]\r\n    [*] Use a flexible template system\r\n    [*] Support fullscreen GUIs (allowing widgets to be placed anywhere on the screen and adapt to all in-game resolutions)\r\n    [*] Use functions that are now implemented! (e.g., GuiInterface:setData)\r\n    [*] Easily translate text with a built-in translation system\r\n    [*] Draw any font you desire in any rotation*\r\n    [*] Create lists with the flexible widgets API.\r\n    [*] Play high-quality compressed 720p video.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nFor examples, check out the [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui/blob/main/Examples]Examples[/url] directory!\r\nFor documentation, refer to the [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui/blob/main/ReGuiDef.lua]ReGuiDef[/url] definition file!\r\nGithub repository can be found [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui]here[/url].\r\nIf you want to ask help, ask us [url=https://discord.gg/DyUxeyAJRz]here[/url]!\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Notes about this library:[/h1]\r\n[quote]\r\n    [h2]This library is not guranteed to work in future game updates![/h2]\r\n    This GUI library uses a JSON bug that allows modders to create MyGui Layout Files! As a result, the library may break in future game updates.\r\n[/quote]\r\n[quote]\r\n    [h2]Consider optimization if you're using sm.regui for animations, etc.[/h2]\r\n    The JSON bug being used will result in bloated files that [b]cannot be deleted without user assistance.[/b]\r\n    \r\n    For example, Anything related for positioning and resizing (as a animation) should be done with controllers to reduce bloat.\r\n[/quote]\r\n[quote]\r\n    [h2]Latest known supported game version[/h2]\r\n    The latest known version that works with this library is: [b]Scrap Mechanic BETA Ver 0.7.3 Build 776[/b]\r\n[/quote]\r\n[quote]\r\n    [h2]Not Supported in MyGui LayoutEditor[/h2]\r\n    sm.regui uses a custom layout file structure (called relayout with the .relayout extension) that wont work with the MyGui Layout editor at all!\r\n\r\n    If you want to create relayout files, you only got a few choices:\r\n    [list]\r\n        [*] Use a editor like [strike][noparse]MyGui.NET[/noparse] For SM[/strike] [i](Note: [noparse]MyGui.NET[/noparse] For SM does not support this yet, but support is planned.)[/i]\r\n        [*] Write the relayout file manually.\r\n        [*] Use a .layout to .relayout converter. (One provided in [i]DevTools/LayoutToRelayout/[/i])\r\n    [/list]\r\n[/quote]",
