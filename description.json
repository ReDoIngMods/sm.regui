(e.g., GuiInterface:setData)\n    [*] Easily translate text with a built-in translation system\n    [*] Draw any font you desire in any rotation*\n    [*] Create lists with the flexible widgets API.\n    [*] Play high-quality compressed 720p video.\n[/list]\n\nFor examples, check out the [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui/blob/main/Examples]Examples[/url] directory!\nFor documentation, refer to the [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui/blob/main/ReGuiDef.lua]ReGuiDef[/url] definition file!\nGithub repository can be found [url=https://github.com/ReDoIngMods/sm.regui]here[/url].\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Notes about this library:[/h1]\n[quote]\n    [h2]This library is not guranteed to work in future game updates![/h2]\n    This GUI library uses a JSON exploit that allows modders to create MyGui Layout Files!
